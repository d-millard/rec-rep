# INTRODUCTION
"""
exception handling is a mechanism for stopping "normal"
program flow and continuing at some surrounding context of code block
"""
# stopping flow with with signal, then continuing on other block of code
# exceptions: key concepts
"""
raise exception - to interrupt program flow (the exception being thrown)
handle exception - resume control (have a handler ready for specific exception raise)
unhandled exceptions - will terminate the program (like index out of range, wacky stuff)
exception objects - contain information about the exceptional even (data of exception)
