WHY USE
(just kinda skimmed this stuff)
to automate and predict mainly
bunch of other reasons but if it is slow and ineffective research best methods

TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS - pg(7)

Types of learning methods:
	- with or without human supervision ( supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and reinforcement learning )
	- whether it can learn incrementally or on the fly ( online vs batch learning )
	- whether they work by comparing new data points to known or detect patterns in training data and building 
	  a predictive model ( instance based learning vs model based learning )

SUPERVISED/UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - pg(8)
classified accourding at amount an type of supervision, there are 4 major catagories:
	supervised
	unsupervised
	semisupervised
	reinforcement learning 

_SUPERVISED LEARNING - pg(8)
in this type of learning, the training data fed to algorithm includes desired solutions.
these solutions are also known as, labels.

a task is classification:
this means it is trained with instances of example data that are know to be either good or bad
and from using this it will classify what makes good and bad and then classigy a new instance.

another task is to predict a target (numeric possible):
this uses features of data (for instance a car has milage, age, year) called predicators.
it is then fed the data of labels (for instance a cars price) and all predicators and creates a 
regression model(graph showing where predicators of that similarity would see as a value (label)) to predict 
what a new instance would be value wise (a cars price).

some regression algorithms can be used for classification and vice versa:
like with the logistic regression, it can output a value (label) that corresponds with probability
to belonging to a certain class (20% of a certain class). this just means that while regression can be just a 
value and classification can be just a class, you can use a value to classify it and a classification to value it.

important supervised learning algorithms:
	- k-Nearest neighbors
	- linear regression
	- logistic regression
	- support vector machines (SVMs)
	- decision trees and random forests
	- neural networks (some can be unsupervised ad semisupervised)

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - pg(10)
training without labels, learn without a teacher
