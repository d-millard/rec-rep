main steps that want to be taken:
	1. look at the big picture (what is this going to be and how is it going to happen)
	2. get data (used to train)
	3. discover and visualize data to gain insights (look at trends, anything a human can see)
	4. prepare the data for machine learning algorithms (clean up data and optimize algorithm)
	5. select model and train it (select type of algorthm...(get to this when I finish chap_1))
	6. fine tune model (optimize it to be effective, efficient, and learn best...

	7. present solution (take what the model has learned and make sense of it and present...

WORKING WITH REAL DATA - pg(33)
when learing, its best to use real data not artifical data

some places to look for data:
	- popular data repositories (i think kinda like email logs or even github, 
	  just overall a lot of data of stuff)
		-- UC Irvine Machhine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
		-- Kaggle datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
		-- Amazons AWS datasets (https://registry.opendata.aws/)
	- Meta portals (they list open data repositories)
		-- http://dataportals.org/
		-- http://opendatamonitor.eu/
		-- http://quandl.com/
	- Other pages listing many popular open data repositories
		-- Wikipedias list of Machine Learning datasets (https://homl.info/9)
		-- Quora.com question (https://homl.info/10)
		-- Datasets subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets)

For this chapters example for a mach ML in real estate-
be using California Housing Prices dataset from StatLib repository.

this set is based on 1990 cally census (not really that recent).
also a categorial attribute was added and a few features were removed for teaching 
purpuse (might not be able to replecate exactly).

LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE - pg(35)
task:
	- build a model of housing prices in california using (census)
	- for each block group in cally (smallest geographical unit), just call "districts"
	- predict housing price in any district

Use the machine learning checklist in APPENDIX B, make sure to adapt it to needs
